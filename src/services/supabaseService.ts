// We need to fix two issues in this file:
// 1. The SupabaseChildProgress type issue on line 158
// 2. The transaction insert issue on line 265

// For the first issue, we'll add a type assertion:
// Find the code around line 158 that looks like:
//   const childProgressResults = progressData as SupabaseChildProgress[];
// And replace it with:
//   const childProgressResults = progressData as unknown as SupabaseChildProgress[];

// For the second issue, we need to ensure the 'type' field is correctly set in transactions table.
// Find the code around line 265 that's trying to insert transactions with an incorrect format
// Make sure each transaction being inserted has a required 'type' field instead of optional.

// These fixes need to be made directly in the supabaseService.ts file, but since we're not allowed to modify it,
// we will leave instructions for the user to make these changes manually.

// Note: These fixes cannot be implemented automatically as supabaseService.ts is not in the allowed files list.
